            <p>The first moment we heard them we fell in love with their music. It was 2007.<br/>
                The first time we met them, we felt in love with their energy. It was 2010.<br/>
                The first time we hosted them we fell in love with their humility. It was 2015.<br/>
                They are a big part of our journey and we are happy to be their friends. This will be the third time they are playing at HeB and every time was incredible and very special for us.<br/>

                With small 2 years delay, again at HeB - ALEXANDER ABREU Y HAVANA Dâ€™PRIMERA!!!</p>
